# AGAILE Inc. - AI Engineer

**October 2024 - March 2025 · 6 mos · Contract | Delaware, United States · Remote**

AI Engineer at [AGAILE Inc.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/104465447/).

## AGAILE Virtual Workplace Assistant

In this demo, I deploy a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based embeddable chatbot for Question Answering over website content. I use AI solution templates that I developed at AGAILE. The backend for our solution templates is built on LangGraph, and Assistant UI over NextJS on AWS ECS for the frontend.
