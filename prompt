IMPORTANT: PLEASE GIVE THE BELOW INSTRUCTIONS AS-IS TO THE DEVELOPER SUBAGENT; DON'T DO IT YOURSELF

use the `playwright mcp` to first go to 'https://arvid.xyz/posts/' and take screenshots
then spin up our own server and go to 'http://localhost:3000/blog' and take screenshots

compare both screenshots, notice the descrepancies, and create a markdown document highlighting what needs to be changed. Here are a few things out of the box:

- the links should not underline on hover
- the year headings should be on the side the blog titles rather than above
continue with more discrepancies and note them
