# Started AI Research Focus

This marks the beginning of my focused journey into AI systems research, particularly around building robust evaluation frameworks and fine-tuning strategies for production AI systems.

## Key Focus Areas

- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Building comprehensive evaluation systems for LLMs that go beyond simple accuracy metrics
- **Fine-tuning Methodologies**: Exploring efficient fine-tuning techniques for specialized tasks
- **Production AI Systems**: Designing and implementing AI systems that are reliable, safe, and performant at scale

## Research Goals

My research focuses on bridging the gap between academic AI research and production deployment, with particular emphasis on:

1. Creating reproducible evaluation benchmarks
2. Developing cost-effective fine-tuning strategies
3. Building monitoring and observability tools for AI systems
4. Ensuring safety and alignment in deployed models

This work combines practical engineering with rigorous experimentation to advance the state of production AI systems.
