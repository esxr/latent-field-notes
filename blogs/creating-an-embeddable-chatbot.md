In these demos, I create and deploy a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based chatbot for Question Answering over website content using AI solution templates that I developed at AGAILE. The backend for our solution templates is built on LangGraph, and Assistant UI over NextJS on AWS ECS for the frontend.

Here are the demos:

I've also discussed extensively on the implementation of the LangGraph based backend in my previous blog:
