# Launched Pranav Dhoolia Blog

Launched this blog as a platform to share my learnings and experiences in building AI systems, with a focus on practical approaches to evals and fine-tuning.

## Motivation

The AI field moves incredibly fast, and I wanted to create a space to:

- Document my learnings and experiments in a structured way
- Share practical insights that can help others building AI systems
- Build a community around thoughtful AI development practices
- Keep myself accountable by writing regularly about my work

## Technical Implementation

The blog is built with modern web technologies:

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 with App Router for optimal performance
- **Content**: Markdown files with frontmatter for easy authoring
- **Features**: RAG-powered chat system for interactive content exploration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design

## Content Focus

Articles cover topics including:

- Evaluation frameworks and methodologies for LLMs
- Fine-tuning techniques and best practices
- Production AI system architecture and design patterns
- Practical experiments and case studies

The goal is to bridge the gap between research and production, focusing on what actually works in real-world AI systems.
