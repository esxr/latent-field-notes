# Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera)

Completed the comprehensive Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera, covering the foundations of deep learning and practical implementation techniques.

## Specialization Overview

This five-course specialization provided in-depth coverage of:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: Fundamentals of neural networks, forward and backward propagation
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks**: Hyperparameter tuning, regularization, optimization
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**: ML strategy, error analysis, transfer learning
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**: CNN architectures, object detection, face recognition
5. **Sequence Models**: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, attention mechanisms, transformers
