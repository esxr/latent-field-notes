# Machine Learning Engineering

Prior experience building and deploying machine learning systems at scale, which laid the foundation for my current focus on AI systems and evaluation.

## Responsibilities

- **Model Deployment**: Led deployment of ML models to production environments using containerization and orchestration tools
- **System Monitoring**: Built comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems for ML pipelines
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized model inference latency and throughput for high-traffic applications
- **Data Pipelines**: Designed and maintained robust data pipelines for training and inference

## Key Achievements

- Reduced model inference latency by 60% through optimization and caching strategies
- Built automated retraining pipelines that improved model accuracy by 15%
- Implemented A/B testing framework for controlled model rollouts
- Established best practices for ML system observability and debugging

## Technologies Used

Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Airflow, Prometheus, Grafana

This experience taught me the importance of treating ML models as software systems, with proper testing, monitoring, and continuous improvement processes.
